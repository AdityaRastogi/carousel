Carousel With Angular 7

1.Folder structure:
-carousel-with-angular
--src
---app
----carousel component
----header component


2.How App runs?
As this App developed using Angular with package.json which contains all dependencies list.

Steps to follow:
>1. Ensure Npm is installed using 'npm -v', if not then install
>2. Ensure angular/cli is installed using 'npm i @angular/cli'
>3.open app in terminal and run 'npm install' to install dependencies
>4.After successful installation of node_modules, run the app using 'ng serve'.
>5. To run unit test cases , use 'ng test'.

3.Why this solution?
To structurize and making generic component used seperate Carousel component which can reused as it is responsive so can be included in any part of application.
So to have everything available at one source and to make application, which can be scaled at any point, have used angular, which also provides clean architecture.
